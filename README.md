## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Terraform: Ensure you have Terraform installed.
- Docker: Required for the development container setup.
- VSCode: Recommended for development, with the Dev Containers extension.

### Development Environment

To get started with development, you can use the pre-configured development container:

1. Open in VSCode:

- Install the Dev Containers extension.
- Open the repository in VSCode.
- You should see a prompt to reopen the project in the dev container.

2. Build and Run:

- The dev container is pre-configured with all the necessary tools and extensions.
- You can start writing and testing your Terraform configurations immediately.

### Terraform Configuration

- Backend Configuration: The `backend.tf` file configures the remote state storage for Terraform.
- Environment Variables: The `environments/` directory contains environment-specific variable files (`.tfvars`).
- Modules: Reusable Terraform modules are stored in the `modules/` directory.

### CI/CD

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically validate and apply your Terraform configurations:

- Terraform Validation: Automatically runs terraform validate on pull requests.
- Stale Issues: Automatically marks issues and pull requests as stale after a period of inactivity.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are set up to ensure code quality and consistency. To install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Contributing
